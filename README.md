# [mdexec][repo]

Run bash scripts inside markdown files!

## Why

Sometimes documentation also offers a command to execute.

Would be nice exec such scripts from terminal.

Some IDE's alr4ady offers to execute scripts.

## How

Add some script blocks:

```bash
echo "Hello there!"
```

```bash
echo "General Kenobi!"
```

Then `mdexec` will offer to run it.
